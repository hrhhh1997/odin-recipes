        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li>4 hot dogs, or your favorite sausages</li>
                <li>4 hot dog buns</li>
                <li>brown mustard</li>
                <li>Cheeses</li>
                <li>1 cup sauerkraut</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat grill or grill pan for medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions, and cook slowly until the onions have softened and 
                    turned deep brown, about 15 minutes. Warm the cream cheese over low heat in a small skillet until very soft.</li>
                <li>Grill hot dogs until well browned. Lightly grill hot dog buns on both sides.</li>
                <li>To assemble cheese dogs, spread warm cream cheese on toasted hot dog bun, add hot dog or sausage, top with onions, 
                    mustard and sauerkraut, if desired.</li>
